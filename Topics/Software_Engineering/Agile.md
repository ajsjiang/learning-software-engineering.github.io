# Agile Software Development

## Introduction

Agile Software Development is an iterative and incremental approach to software development that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer satisfaction. It is a set of values and principles that guide the development process, allowing teams to respond to changing requirements and deliver high-quality software in a more efficient and effective manner.

## History

**Pre-Agile Era**: Before the emergence of Agile, software development predominantly followed the [Waterfall](./Software_Engineering/Waterfall.md) model, a linear and sequential approach. In this model, each phase of development, such as requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance, occurs in a strict order, with little room for iteration or revisiting previous stages.

**The Agile Manifesto (2001)**: The defining moment in the history of Agile came in 2001 when a group of seventeen software developers, including luminaries like Kent Beck, Martin Fowler, and Alistair Cockburn, convened at Snowbird, Utah, to discuss lightweight development methods. The result of this meeting was the creation of the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/), a foundational document that articulated the guiding principles and values of Agile Software Development.

The Agile Manifesto emphasized four key values:

1. **Individuals and interactions over processes and tools**
2. **Working software over comprehensive documentation**
3. **Customer collaboration over contract negotiation**
4. **Responding to change over following a plan**

This manifesto, along with its twelve supporting principles, laid the groundwork for a paradigm shift in software development philosophy.

## Post-Manifesto Growth

Following the establishment of the Agile Manifesto, various Agile methodologies and frameworks emerged, each providing a specific set of practices to implement Agile principles effectively. Notable among these are Scrum, Kanban, and Extreme Programming (XP), each offering a unique approach to Agile development.

## Agile Manifesto Values

1. **Individuals and interactions over processes and tools**:
    - Agile teams value the collaboration and communication between team members. They prioritize face-to-face interactions and effective teamwork to ensure the success of the project. While processes and tools are important, they are secondary to having a good team and clear communication.
    - **Example**: Consider a scenario where a complex algorithm needs to be implemented. In a process-centric approach, there might be a heavy reliance on tools and predefined procedures to execute the task. In contrast, an Agile team values the expertise and collaboration of its members. They may opt for collaborative coding sessions or discussions to find the most efficient solution. This focus on individual skills and teamwork fosters creativity and problem-solving, leading to more innovative and effective solutions.

2. **Working software over comprehensive documentation**:
    - Agile teams focus on delivering working software that provides value to the customer. While documentation is important, it is kept to a minimum and is only created when necessary. The main goal is to deliver a functioning product, not to produce extensive documentation.
    - **Example**: In a traditional waterfall model, extensive documentation is often produced before any code is written. In an Agile project, the emphasis is on delivering working software at the earliest opportunity. For instance, instead of spending weeks creating detailed system documentation, the Agile team might prioritize delivering a minimum viable product (MVP) quickly. This allows stakeholders to interact with the actual software sooner, providing valuable insights and facilitating iterative improvements.

3. **Customer collaboration over contract negotiation**:
    - Agile teams prioritize regular and direct communication with the customer to understand their needs and expectations. This collaboration helps in delivering software that aligns with the customer's requirements. It's not just about delivering what's in the contract, but working together to ensure the product meets the customer's needs.
    - **Example**: Imagine a software development team is working on an e-commerce platform. In a traditional, contract-centric approach, the team might strictly adhere to the initially agreed-upon features and functionalities. However, in an Agile environment, the team regularly collaborates with the customer to gather feedback. If the customer expresses a need for additional features like a personalized recommendation system, the Agile team can quickly adjust the development roadmap to incorporate these changes, ensuring the final product better meets the customer's vision.

4. **Responding to change over following a plan**:
    - Agile teams embrace change and are flexible in adapting to new requirements or priorities. They value feedback and continuously improve the software based on customer input. Instead of sticking rigidly to a plan, Agile teams are ready to change direction if it benefits the project.
    - **Example**: Consider a mobile app development project where the initial plan outlines a specific set of features to be delivered in each development phase. In an Agile setting, if user feedback or market trends indicate a need for a fundamental change, such as a shift in the user interface design, the Agile team can swiftly adapt. Instead of rigidly sticking to the original plan, Agile allows for continuous adjustments, ensuring the final product is not only functional but also aligned with the latest user preferences.

## Agile Manifesto Principles

1. **"Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software."**

2. **"Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage."**

3. **"Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference for the shorter timescale."**

4. **"Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project."**

5. **"Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done."**

6. **"The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation."**

7. **"Working software is the primary measure of progress."**

8. **"Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely."**

9. **"Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility."**

10. **"Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential."**

11. **"The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams."**

12. **"At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly."**

The 12 Agile principles collectively emphasize a customer-centric, adaptable, and collaborative approach to software development. Prioritizing customer satisfaction, Agile promotes the early and continuous delivery of working software, welcoming changing requirements throughout the development process. It emphasizes frequent, iterative releases, fostering collaboration between business stakeholders and development teams. Agile teams are built around motivated individuals, engaging in face-to-face communication whenever possible. The primary measure of progress is the delivery of working software, and a sustainable pace of work is maintained to ensure long-term productivity. Technical excellence, good design, simplicity, and self-organizing teams are key tenets, fostering innovation and adaptability. Regular reflections on processes drive continuous improvement, making Agile a dynamic and customer-focused methodology.

## Waterfall vs Agile

In the Waterfall model, development follows a linear, sequential approach, with each phase completed before moving on to the next. It is a structured methodology that is well-suited for projects with well-defined requirements, providing a clear progression of steps, products, and processes. However, changes after project initiation are challenging, and testing occurs after the build phase. For more information, visit our [Waterfall](./Software_Engineering/Waterfall.md).

On the other hand, Agile is a continuous iteration life cycle model that embraces flexibility and collaboration. It allows for changes even after initial planning, emphasizing team interaction, customer satisfaction, and delivering working software in small, incremental releases. Agile is suited for projects with evolving requirements, promoting adaptability and a transparent development process. Testing is performed in the same iteration as programming, ensuring early bug detection.
